\begin{abstract}
Multi-modal facial emotion recognition is one of the more challenging tasks of computer vision. Previous work has been primarily focused on six basic emotions. This project focus on non-basic simultaneous emotion/expression classification. We extend the pool of learned expression to thirteen classes by the addition of mental states such as thinking, concentrated, and etc. We also mention results currently available in the literature and draw comparisons with our own. To best of our knowledge, the accuracy obtained by our models is higher than those available in the literature.
